# Composer Check Current Working Directory Plugin

## Installation

```
composer global require jcab/composer-check-cwd-plugin
```

## Usage

Just use Composer as usual.

This plugin will only throw you a warning if no `composer.json` was found. By default, Composer does not search for an existing `composer.json` in the folder structure and try to proceed where you asked it to. This can be frustrating sometimes, this plugin may help.
